                    Mark E. Dean is an African American innovator in the field of technology and computing.  At a time when diversity and inclusion was not very prevalent within working environments, Mark Dean managed to navigate his way through a hostile situation and accomplish incredible things.  After a break of 14 years, Mark Dean re-admitted himself into the education system and received his doctoral degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.  It is important to highlight the work of Mark Dean due to his ability to blaze a trail for future African Americans interested in the field of computing.
